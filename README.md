# Currency-Exchange-Microservices
Currency Exchange Microservices

In this project, I endeavored to create a microservices-based currency exchange system. Using H2 database, I managed to add
data in an in-memory format and facilitated the sharing of this data among services through Feign clients. By utilizing Eureka, I
ensured that these services could discover each other by their names, and I implemented API routing using an API gateway.
Additionally, I closely monitored API requests in detail using Zipkin to enhance the system's performance and traceability.
Below, you can find the technologies I used:

- Spring Boot
- Spring Cloud
- Hibernate - JPA
- H2 Database
- Eureka
- API Gateway
- Zipkin
- Flyway
- Docker
